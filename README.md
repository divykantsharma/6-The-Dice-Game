# 6-The-Dice-Game
Made this project with the help of JavaScript and using the DOM model.

-> A simple dice game on a webpage. It randomly generates two numbers between 1 and 6, which correspond to the faces of the dice. The code then updates the source attribute of two dice images with the randomly generated numbers, causing the images to display the appropriate dice faces.

-> After that, the code compares the random numbers and updates the title element (h1) based on the comparison result. If the first random number is greater than the second, it displays "ğŸš© Player 1 Wins!" as the title. If the second random number is greater, it displays "Player 2 Wins! ğŸš©". Otherwise, if both random numbers are equal, it displays "Draw!" as the title.
